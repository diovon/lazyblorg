This is a test article which tests its links to other (internal) blog entries.

- This should work [[id:2016-10-31-persistent-entry][in lists]] as [[id:2016-11-27-special-characters][well]].
- This should work [[id:2016-10-31-persistent-entry]] and [[id:2016-11-27-special-characters]].

Here is [[id:2017-09-30-link-test][a self-reference]] which should not result in a backlink to itself.

*** Even [[id:2016-10-31-my-temporal-article][a heading should]] work

What about [[id:2016-10-31-an-hidden-blog-entry][a hidden entry]]?
